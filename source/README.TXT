Grass cut v3



When the program starts you will be given the choice between three options:
    
	Default - This will start the game with the standard difficulty.
    
	Custom - This allows you to modify the games difficulty.
    
	Quit - This terminates the program.
    


When the game starts, you will be met with a grid of three different color tiles
    
	Green - Grass blocks (run over to mow them).
    
	Yellow - Sand blocks (run over to pause movement).
    
	Red - Hazard blocks (hit this and you lose).
    


The goal of the game is to eliminate all grass and sand blocks without hitting any red.



Good luck, happy mowing!
